This year, Chris Schaffner did not manage to make a static copy in time, as he was transitioning my tasks to Wouter Jansen. Therefore, the links in this subdirectory are broken. For completeness, they are included here anyways.

One should be able to use the version on the web.archive.org instead: http://web.archive.org/web/20170825134443/windmilltournament.com/
