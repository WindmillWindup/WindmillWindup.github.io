            <p>
                From 19:00 to 21:00 trials for the Charity Pull competition will take place. 
                If you have someone in your team that can pull like a champion, make sure they are involved!

            <h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DouglasFirsMusic#p/f/2/pzmHei9g-MU">Douglas Firs, 21:15 to 22:00</a></h4>
            <p>
                Douglas Firs is Gertjan Van Hellemont, 
                a young singer-musician-producer from Belgium who plays Harmony guitars and americana-like songs.
				<br />Beautiful music, actually.
            </p>
            <h4>The Hangin' DJ, 22:00 to 01:00</h4>
            <p> 
                The Hangin' DJ (Roel Idema) 
                plays the alternative and obscure but doesn't shy away from the contemporary indiepop/stonerrock. 
                Be ready for a balanced mix of Wave, grunge, rock-'n-roll and tunes that will set your feet on fire.

            <h4>Let's kill the moonshine, 20:00 to 24:00</h4>
            <p> 
                This interactive and real shooting gallery is based on Marinetti's manifest Futurismo.
                Futurists reject to the idea of the vulnerable, everyday human chasing the dream of perfection. 
                Instead they choose chaos as a starting point for art, Modern art? 
                One 100 years later there is still an urge to clean up. We invite you to take a gun and Kill the Moonshine. 
                Shoot your sentimental darlings, make way for the Future.

            <h4><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64KXVKhOqPc">Casper Adrian, 20:30 to 21:15</a></h4>
            <p> 
                Casper Adrian's music is disarming and straightforward.
                In his songs he questions himself and the world around him. 
                While he's not afraid to ask the big questions, life's simpler themes are paid attention as well. 
                His style is a typical mix of folk, blues and pop and he strives to find a perfect balance between entertainment and awareness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Willing Wheels will once again serve delicious three course diners from the yellow restaurant bus. 
                During dinner we will have the infamous Mr. Steel from Amsterdam back at the Windmill. 
                Many enjoyed his chill carribbean sounds during Windmill IV and we expect the same response this year! 
                Check his music <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgdQ_lmNhI">here</a>.
			</p>
             
            <h4>Mingle Mingle & Beer race, 20:30 to 21:30</h4>
            <p>
                We kick the night off with the 7th edition of the massive Mingle Mingle, 
                a huge gathering of people dancing and mingling and laughing with eachother. 
                The game is simple, grab yourself a random partner, arrange yourselves into the called out positions. 
                Prizes for the winning duo
            </p>
            <p>
                Next is a new and improved version of the Beer Race 
                - grab a partner, look for a sign up sheet, and enjoy a great start to your Saturday party night. 
            </p>
            <h4>Party, 23:00 to 4:00</h4>
            <p>
                Then, the PARTY! 
                Fully warmed up after the beer race, the boys from The Benelux will kick the party into high gear. 
                THE BENELUX is a 4 headed wolf band, 
                a vintage electronic shock of tasteful noise, 
                beats and resonating vocals that makes you want to kneel on the dancefloor and pray for more. 
                For a sneak preview click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOR6kvYqE8&playnext=1&list=PL5856F2DBE5EFCB5E">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
                Once you're in full swing, 
                DJ Double D and Windmill's own DJ Team with DJ Snowy, 
                DJ Phreak du Fonque will rip up the dance floor with some choice tunes that will keep your feet 
                bouncing till the early morning.

            <h4>Musical surprise,  around breakfast</h4>
            <p>
                Sunday morning, breakfast, rays of light bounce from the fierce elephant. 
                The players prepare for their final battles, 
                one more coffee and a banana, 
                stuffed away in the side pocket of a backpack. 
                Something is missing, but what? 
			</p>
            
            <h4>Accuracy competition, first time-out during final</h4>
            <p>
                In the first time-out of the final you can show your throwing accuracy by hitting moving targets. 
                Full hits will be awarded with nice prizes, 
                full details will be disclosed during the tournament. 
			</p>
            
            <h4>Windmill Huck competition, halftime of open final</h4>
            <p>
                Following the Friday preliminaries we will have 3 finalists in both the open and the women division 
                making their appearance in the final. 
                Every thrower gets to throw their share of discs and make a run for infinite glory!
				<br />Check out the Huck competition, sponsored by Bugaboo International BV. 
                Winners get the glory, some fancy Windmill gear AND has done his / her share to help us raise money for a great cause.
