    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <h2>Windmill Windup tournament will apply the WFDF 2009 rules</h2>
    <br />You can find the new rules at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.wfdf.org/index.php?page=news/WFDF_Rules_of_Ultimate_2009.html">WFDF site</a>. 
    WFDF has produced an <a href="http://rjhberg.googlepages.com/WFDFRulesofUltimate2009-Interpretati.pdf">Interpretations document</a> to provide some common examples of how to apply the rules.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Open, Mixed & Ladies games are to 15 points within 90 minute timeslots – after 85 minutes you
will hear the “time is over” jingle. Play out the current point, add 1 to the highest score with a
maximum of 15 points, and finish the match. You will also hear a jingle two minutes prior to each
timeslot start and another at the start time. Please start your matches on time and be aware that
another match is on your field in the next timeslot</li>
        <li>All games in all divisions on Sunday are to 15 points, no time cap.
 Captains can arrange to move a game to a vacant field should a game on their assigned field be
running over time.</li>
        <li>All games have 2 minute mirror half time at 8 points.</li>
        <li>Each team has 2 time-outs per game.</li>
        <li>The latest WFDF rules apply at this tournament.</li>
        <li>Teams will be ranked after each round according to swiss points. For teams with the same number
of swiss points, the tiebreakers are: most wins, fewest losses, and opponent swiss points (in that
order). The last is the sum of the opponent's victory points (teams that have played better
opponents are ranked higher).</li>
        <li>It is very important that match scores are uploaded to <a rel="external" href="http://www.leaguevine.com">Leaguevine</a> after each game. Otherwise, the
whole schedule could be held up. Please make sure you have one person who uploads your scores
to the <a rel="external" href="https://m.leaguevine.com">Leaguevine mobile site</a> or that one of the scoring volunteers does this for you.
Captains are ultimately responsible for ensuring that scores are properly uploaded. Thanks.</li>

<!--
        <li>Normally, all divisions will play 8 games (5 in the Swiss Draw, then Quarter, Semi and Final). However, du to a small number of teams, we use a different format for this year's women's division.</li>
        
        <li>Games are to 15 points or 90 minutes - after 85 minutes, the '5 minutes left' jingle will sound. 
        	Play out the point, add 1 to the highest score with a maximum of 15 points, and finish the match.</li>
        
<!--        <li>On the final day all games in all divisions are to 15 points, no time cap.</li>
        
        <li>Captains can arrange to move a game to a vacant field should a game on their assigned field be running over time.</li>

        <li>All games have a 2-minute mirror half time at 8 points.</li>

        <li>Each team has 2 time-outs per game.</li>

        <li>Due to the Swissdraw format, it is very important that match scores are reported to the organisor's tent (tournament directors) or scoring staff member (blue shirts with walky-talkies) <strong>immediately</strong> after each game. 
		The matchups of the following round can only be computed when all scores of this round are known.
        	Please make sure you help us with this. If you do not have a scorekeeper at your field, please do it yourself and report your scores to the organisor's tent. Captains are ultimately responsible for ensuring that scores are properly reported.</li>
-->

        <li>Teams are given one spirit sheet per day. Please make sure you hand in the filled-in the spirit sheets after the last game of every day.</li>

    </ul>

    <a name="format"></a>
    <h1>Format</h1>  

<!--
    <h2>Women's Division: Seeding, Pools, Playoffs</h2>
    <p>With just 13 teams in the women's division, the Swissdraw system does not work well. We are therefore using the format from 2009. In their first game, the teams play a "seeding round". Then three pools (of five, four and four teams) are formed which play a round Robin. For the last three games, the teams form a playoff pool of 8 and 5 teams. The detailed scheme can be found in the player's pack. 

	<p class="ancortop"><a href="#top">click to top</a></p>
-->
	<h2>Mixed format (4/3):</h2>
	<p>
		We play normal 4-3 mixed. Each point the O team decides whether it's 4 boys or 4 girls. O must be clear and hasty about which it will be so D has time to match and strategise before the next pull.
	</p>


	
    <h2>Swiss Draw for all divisions: Women, Mixed and Open</h2>
    <p>
		The <a rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament">Swiss Draw format</a> ensures that teams are ranked quickly according to their real strength and play close matches against opponents of similar strength. 
		Windmill Windup is proud to have successfully run this format for years.
    </p>
    <p>
       The first round match-ups are virtually random. In every game, the difference between scores is converted to Victory Points using the following scale.
    </p>
    
    
    <div class="dark" stle="margin:40px">
	    <strong>Victory Point (VP) Scale</strong>
	        <table id="tableVP">
	            <tbody>
	                <tr>
	                    <th>Margin of Victory</th>
	                    <th>VPs for Winner</th>
	                    <th>VPs for Loser</th>
	                </tr>    
	                <tr><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>2</td><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>3</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>4</td><td>19</td><td>11</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>10</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>6</td><td>21</td><td>9</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>7</td><td>22</td><td>8</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>8</td><td>23</td><td>7</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>9</td><td>24</td><td>6</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>5</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>11</td><td>25</td><td>4</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>12</td><td>25</td><td>3</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>2</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>14</td><td>25</td><td>1</td></tr>
	                <tr><td>15</td><td>25</td><td>0</td></tr>
	            </tbody>
	        </table>
	</div>
	
        <p>So the maximum you can get is 25 VPs and the minimum 0.</p>
        
        <p>This is popular because teams nearly always score something and the whole point of the draw system is that a team, clearly beaten, needs to battle to the finish as it is the margin which matters. Likewise, just winning is not winning much.</p>
        <p>The draw for the next round simply consists of ranking the teams by VPs and resorting to allow that no team plays the same team twice. 1st plays 2nd, 3rd plays 4th etc. etc. A team's VPs are carried forward throughout the tournament.</p>
        
        <p>
For teams with the same number
of swiss points, the tiebreakers are: most wins, fewest losses, and opponent swiss points (in that
order). The last is the sum of the opponent's victory points (teams that have played better
opponents are ranked higher).
        </p>
        <!--<p>Tie-break method for teams that have an equal amount of VPs at the end of the second or higher round of the Swiss Draw: sum of the opponent's victory points (teams that have played better opponents are ranked higher), total points scored, spirit score. 
		At the end of the first round, the sum of the opponent's victory points does not say anything yet, so tie-breaker method at the end of the first round is: goal difference, total points scored, seeding.</p>-->
		<p>
You will play 5 rounds of this format to rank the teams. At the end of 5 rounds, the division
splits into 1-8, 9-rest, depending on the number of teams in the division. The top 8 teams will
play quarter finals, semi finals and finals to get their final finishing position, the rest will
continue with the Swiss draw rounds 6-8.
		</p>
       <!-- <p>All divisions will play 5 rounds of this format to rank the teams. At the end of 5 rounds, the divisions split into 1-8, 9-16, 17-24 etc. These groups will play quarter finals, semi finals and finals to get your final finishing position 
		(playoff pools with a number of teams different from 8 in each division will have a slightly different play-off sequence). </p>-->
	
	<!--<p>In the unfortunate case of an odd number of teams in a division, a ''ghost team'' called BYE is introduced in the Swissdraw pool to make it an even number of teams. The BYE team figures as real team in the ranking, but in every round, 
		the team that is supposed to play the BYE team has a break and is assigned a 15-12 win. The Swiss Draw format ensures that no team has two breaks in the first five rounds. However, under unlucky circumstances, it can happen
		that a team which already had a break during the Swissdraw phase, has another break during the playoffs.<p>-->

        <p>If this explanation is as clear as mud to you, then feel free to email us with questions, or ask us at the tournament. Yeah! Swiss Draw rocks!</p>
