			<h3><a name="Accommodation"></a>ACCOMMODATION</h3>
			<p class="p2">We will be setting up camp in our on-site tent city, we will have camping marshals to show you when you get there. If you want to stay in a hostel or hotel, we will try to provide some limited accommodation but would advise booking something yourself. These links should set you on the right track<br><br><a href="http://www.hotels.nl/" target="_new">hotels.nl</a><br><a href="http://www.cheapaccommodation.com/Amsterdam/Hostel/" target="_new">youth hostel information</a></p>
			<p class="p2">There is one very convenient hotel to the fields, but it is not that cheap for a single person. Click this link for details in english:<br><a href="http://www.hemhotels.nl/" target="_new">http://www.hemhotels.nl/</a><br>A twin room will cost 79 euro per night. You can make a reservation by calling +31205106959</p>
			<p class="p3">The camping area will be open as of 17:00 on Thursday the 28th of June, but if you would like to arrive earlier on Thursday, you are welcome to, though it will be at your own risk -- there will not be anyone supervising the camping area before Thursday evening. </p>
			<p class="p3">Camping at the fields will be on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights of the tournament. If you want pre or post tournament camping <a href="http://www.amsterdam.info/camping/" target="_new">this link</a> has information all about camping in / around amsterdam.</p>
			
			<h3><a name="format"></a>FORMAT</h3>
			<p class="p1">The Women&rsquo;s Division will be 2 pools of five teams, followed by new pools of top 6 and bottom 4 teams (carrying results), then the final ranking game. The format is fully detailed in <a href="files/Ladies&#32;seeding&#32;and&#32;Schedule.xls" target="_new">this spreadsheet</a>. If at least 18 women's teams enter, we will use the Swiss Draw format as described below.</p>
			<p class="p2">The Open Division will once again feature a draw innovation which made its debut at previous windups. You'll taste the delights of the Swiss Draw format which was first devised and used for chess competitions in Switzerland.</p>
			<p class="p3">In the Open Division, all games will be played out to 15 points, no time restriction, this is traditional from previous windups. The organisors reserve the right to impose time cap on games if weather or conditions or other factors play a role.</p>
			<p class="p3">We are lucky enough to have a sufficient number of fields so that all the teams in the Open division are playing matches simultaneously. The first round match-ups are virtually random. Then&hellip;</p>
			<p class="p3">Scorekeepers will report the scores to Frisbee Central (TD). Each game has its win-loss converted to Victory Points. That is, the difference between scores is converted to Victory Points using the following scale.</p>
			
			<TABLE ID="tableVP">
				<CAPTION>Victory Point (VP) Scale<br><br></CAPTION>
				<TR class="row0">
					<TD>Margin of Victory</TD>
					<TD>VPs for Winner</TD>
					<TD>VPs for Loser</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>1</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>14</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>2</TD><TD>17</TD><TD>13</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>3</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>12</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>4</TD><TD>19</TD><TD>11</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>5</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>10</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>6</TD><TD>21</TD><TD>9</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>7</TD><TD>22</TD><TD>8</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>8</TD><TD>23</TD><TD>7</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>9</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>6</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>10</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>5</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>11</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>12</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>3</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>13</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>2</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>14</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>1</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>15</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>0</TD></TR>
			</TABLE>

			<p class="p3">So the maximum you can get is 25 VPs and the minimum 0.</p>
			<p class="p3">This is popular because teams nearly always score something and the whole point of the style is that a team, clearly beaten, needs to battle to the finish as it is the margin which matters. Likewise, just winning is not winning much.</p>
			<p class="p3">The draw for the next round simply consists of ranking the teams by VPs. and resorting to allow that no team plays the same team twice. 1st plays 2nd, 3rd plays 4th etc. etc. A team&rsquo;s VPs are carried forward throughout the tournament.</p>
			<p class="p3">Tie-break method for teams that have an equal amount of VPs at the end of any given Round of the Swiss Draw: For &ndash; Against (goal difference) for the whole tournament thus far. If teams are still tied, it will go to Spirit scores, and then a random method will be used at the TDs discretion (probably a coin toss or random number or paper-scissors-rock).</p>
			<p class="p3">It has been mathematically shown that, for 22 teams, 6 rounds of this format are ideal to rank the teams. At the end of 6 rounds, the division splits into 1-8, 9-16 &amp; 17-22. These groups will play quarter finals, semi finals and finals to get your final finishing position.</p>
			<p class="p3">If this explanation is as clear as mud to you, then feel free to email us with questions, or ask us at the tournament. Yeah! Remember, this Swiss Draw is tried and true in many competitive arenas. I have personally seen it work well at Bridge and Touch Football tournaments back home in Australia, as well as last year's Windup.</p>
			<p class="p3">It is very important that team captains ensure that the TD has their match scores <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> when each game finishes. Otherwise calculating the following round games will be impossible. Please give us all your help with this. If you do not have a scorekeeper at your field, please do it yourself and report your scores to the organisor&rsquo;s tent.</p>
			<p class="p3">Thank you!</p>

			<h3><a name="winddown"></a>PARTIES </h3>
			<p class="p1">All Abroad the Partytrain. How can you possibly come to Amsterdam and not party? Exaclty, two nites of dutchy vibes mixed with local and international tunes.</p>
			<h4>Friday Night</h4>
			<p class="p2">Our Friday night includes the newly added <strong>Speed Dating Option</strong> for all our Ultimate Singles. There will be a limited first come, first served dinner at the fields(Pizza&amp;BBQ). But we advise most teams to take it easy and make their way <a href="files/metro.pdf" target="_new">via Metro</a> (or van) to the <strong>Nieuwmarkt Area</strong> (close to Red Light District) to taste some tasty Thai (or other cuising). Restaurents in the area are listed on the <a href="amsterdam.htm#restaurants">Amsterdam page</a>. </p>
			<p class="p2">After dinner, there is a meet and party venue on the Nieuwmarkt. (<strong>details in players pack plus coming here soon</strong>). Late Buses and Metro&rsquo;s will get you back to the fields, and otherwise we have some easy going van drivers that will pick up and drop you at your tent.</p>
			<p class="p2">Speed dating details: basically males and females have 3 minutes to introduce themselves to a potential mate.  In that time they cannot discuss ultimate.  After 3 minutes they will move on to the next mate.  After many mating rounds the dates will finish and they will write down who they would like to have more contact with.  When the names match we will introduce them and the mating ritual will continue according to their taste.</p>

			<h4>Saturday Night</h4>
			<p class="p3">On Saturday, Party at the fields! We start off with the now famous <strong>Dutchy Delight Beer Race</strong>: A strange mix of speed, crazyness and ability is needed to win our dutchy obstacle course designed to show you the better sides of amsterdam in just under 10 minutes. Bubbly prizes for the winners. </p>
			<p class="p3">The race is followed by the <strong>second edition</strong> remodeled Massively Intense <strong>Mingle Mingle</strong>, a huge gathering of people dancing and mingling with other teams to only be stopped by the call of positions by the loud mouth announcer. The game is simple, find yourself a partner, grab them and get into the called out positions. Naughty prizes for the winning couple.</p>
			<p class="p3">Then, the Party! To start it of we&rsquo;ve got the band <a href="http://www.bomblb.nl" target="_new">BombLB</a>, they&rsquo;ll funk you. Once they&rsquo;ve raised the roof, we fly in the dj&rsquo;s and get the party bumping. Local dj&rsquo;s DJ Didier Drogba &amp; DJ Snowy will rip up the dance floor with phat tunes made 2 get you bumpin&rsquo;, bouncin&rsquo; and boppin&rsquo;. The classic Chocomel Chug will also be made available at the bar during the evening, as well as a new Windmill addition of Musical Chairs with a Twist. </p>



			<h3><a name="food"></a>FOOD </h3>
			<h4>Breakfast/Lunch</h4>
			<p class="p1">We will be providing breakfast / lunch on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We will aim for good quantity and quality. Yum yum. We encourage you to make your lunch in the morning from the plentiful ingredients at breakfast. Also, there will be food sales at the organization tent, including pasta salads, gourment sandwiches, cold sports drinks and soda, and granola and chocolate snacks. </p>

			<h4>Saturday Dinner</h4>
			<p class="p2">We will also provide dinner on Saturday night at the fields before the party at no extra cost. </p>

			<h4>Friday Dinner</h4>
			<p class="p2">On Friday evening after the matches, we will be selling limited amounts of pizza and BBQ goodies.  We encourage you to go out as a team on Friday to find a restaurant near the Nieuwmarkt (see maps in player packs and on the bulletin boards around the fields), get a glimpse of the heart of Amsterdam and join the party evening that we have planned for you, but we will be selling a limited amount of food at the fields for those who are interested.  You can order pizzas at the main registration and organization tent.  We will be serving on Friday evening between 18:00 and 21:00. Pizzas will be made onsite and hand tossed, with ingredients delivered by the leading pizza delivery chain in holland :)</p>

			<h4>Other Meals</h4>
			<p class="p3">You will find a list of restaurants in the area posted at the registration and organization tent.</p>
