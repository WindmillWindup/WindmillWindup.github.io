<title>61 percent of teams paid Green Fee</title>
<description><![CDATA[You can check which teams have paid the Green Fee <a href="http://www.windmillwindup.com/2013/teams/
">on this page</a>

Herbie says: Thank You!

Haven't paid the team fee yet? Just shoot us an email and transfer your € 50,- to the Windmill bank account.

Until all the teams pay the Green Fee, the Windmill Windup will pay for those teams that don't participate in this program to offset 100 percent of the travelling of ALL the players. 

We do this by investing in green energy windmills in Turkey.

Last year we had 60 percent of the teams participating as you can see in this video by Steve and Herbie from 2012:

<title>Most teams paid carbon offset fee</title>
<description><![CDATA[The team fees are in and we're psyched to tell you that over 60% of the teams decided to offset their carbon footprint. 
 
<p>
These teams paid € 50,- extra per team (€ 3,- per player) and took their environmental responsibility. Beforehand we were expecting lower double digits, but this turnout is beyond our expectations.
</p>

<p>
Our Green Manager Steve Green is walking around with a smile on his pretty face: "This shows the character of an  ultimate player consists of three elements: athleticism, partyism and social responsibility."
</p>

<p>
For those who haven't paid the € 50,- the Windmill organisation will pay their fee to offset their carbon footprint out of the tournament's budget.
</p>

<p>
"It's never too late to join the party", Steve continues, "every captain that hasn't paid the € 50,- per team yet, can transfer the money before May 15th and will be recognized as a responsible person and team. Just see it as an additional € 3 per player!"
</p>
 
<p>
The Windmill Windup is representin' and just invested, on behalf of over 49 teams, in a <a href="http://www.windmillwindup.com/2012/docs/WW2012_CO2logic_CO2 Neutral_Certificate.pdf">Gold Standard</a> windmill energy project in Turkey to offset 300 tons of CO2. This is enough to offset the carbon footprint of all the player's traveling to Amsterdam.
</p>

<p>
Steve, Herbie and the entire Windmill Organization would like to thank all the teams that took their responsibility and we hope this is step will set an example for future events.
</p>

<p>

<title>4000 euro for charity </title>
<description><![CDATA[This year, thanks to Bugaboo who sponsored us and the contestants who did the pulling, the <a href="http://www.windmillwindup.com/2010/charity/#pull">pull competition</a> was able to raise 1500 euros.

<p>
As Windmill does every year 2 euros from the player fee is donated as well. Factoring all the other great charity events including the Pub Quiz, the Radio Requests and random donations we were able to raise a total of 4000 euros for <a href="http://windmillwindup.com/2010/charity/">Open Arms Malawi</a>!!! 
<br />This translates to about 670 weeks of baby formula for infants in need. Or, in simpler terms, it translates to the possibility for Open Arms Malawi to continue to provide the love, help and opportunity to those who may otherwise not have had a chance.
</p>
<p>
Special thanks goes out to the 6 contestants for their incredible hucking skills, we hope you enjoy your prizes:
<br /><strong>Men:</strong>
<br />Luca (Freespeed)
<br />Lorenz (FAB)
<br />New-New (Mor Ho!)
<br/>
<br /><strong>Women:</strong>
<br />Franzi (DeLux)
<br />Nan (Rusty Bikes)
<br />Mel (Woodchicas)
</p>
<p> 
Extra special thanks goes out to <a href="http://windmillwindup.com/2010/sponsors/">Bugaboo</a> for sponsoring the event. And, of course we could not have done it without you the people! We hope to host this event again next year so if you watched and thought 'I could pull better than that', then come again next year and show case that awesome talent!
</p>

<title>The Windmill Windup Radio Station (WWRS)</title>
<description><![CDATA[We here at Windmill Windup Headquarters are happy to announce the addition of a new project to the already action-packed Windmill agenda: <a href="http://www.windmillwindup.com/2010/news/The-Windmill-Windup-Radio-Station-%28WWRS%29/">The Windmill Windup Radio Station (WWRS)</a>.
<p>
Throughout Windmill we'll be playing the music and jingles you've heard in previous years, but on top of that Bicyclemark, myself, and our team of correspondents will be coaxing you out of your morning fog with a gentle breakfast soundtrack, conducting interviews, spicing up your day with heeelarious commentary, and running some listener contests as well.
</p>

<strong>So where do you come in?</strong>

<p>
1) This year we'll be running a Spotify-powered WWRS Jukebox, taking requests all day long.  Get pumped for your games, chill out to your favorite tunes, and wow everyone with your oh-so-impressive musical tastes, for just 50 cents per request!  5 songs for 2 euros!  All proceeds will go to our official tournament charity: <a href="http://windmillwindup.com/2010/charity/">Open Arms Malawi</a>.
</p>
<p>
2) We'd love to diversify our team of correspondents with some international members. If you're interested in trying out your radio persona, or just goofing around with me and Bicyclemark and having a say in what music gets played, feel free to send an email to carly.blair@gmail.com.
</p>
<p>
Gather up your pocket change for those requests, and see you next weekend out on the fields!
</p>
<p>
Luv,
<br />Carly, Bicyclemark, and the rest of the WWRS team
</p>]]></description>

<title>Discs for All, bring your discs!</title>
<description><![CDATA[This year again, all participants will receive the traditional Windmill disc with a funky design 
- for those of you with many discs, bring some old ones, as we will be collecting discs 
- old, new or just ugly - that people no longer use 
and send them off to teams and trainers in different parts of Africa (first shipment to Rwanda). 
The 'Discs for Africa' project 
- soon to become the Discs for All project, watch this <a href="http://ffindr.com/en/blog/2010/01/27/bringing-frisbee-to-africa">space</a> 
- brings many ultimate values together: recycling, spreading the love of our game, and putting smiles on faces.

<title>The teams for the windmill windup 2010 have been announced.</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
Because almost 60 open teams registered, and because the number of fields does not allow us to accommodate all teams interested in playing open at WW2010, we had to make a waiting list. 
Find the list of Windmill Windup 2010 teams <a href="http://www.windmillwindup.com/2010/teams/">here</a>.  
</p>
<p>
If your team is on the waiting list, please keep in mind that there is still a chance that we will have a spot for you.  
Our payment deadline is already on April 30th, so teams that are coming, please pay on time, and teams that are on the waiting list, stay tuned!
