			<h3><a name="changes"></a>IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR 2008</h3>
			<h4>New Location</h4>
			<p class="p1">Our traditional home is now little more than a hole in the ground. So therefore the 2008 windup will be at a new location. Address: Drie Burgpad, 1098, Amsterdam. For maps and directions go to our <a href="directions.htm">Directions page</a>.</p>
			<h4>Satellite Fields (Bicycle Is Good)</h4>
			<p class="p1">This year we have a main set of fields and a smaller secondary set. These secondary satellite fields are nearby but not really within walking distance for weary ultimate legs. We will provide transport buses but far more convenient for players is to hire a bicycle for your stay in amsterdam, then you can move around at your own schedule and probably faster. Its how all the locals get around, and a great way to explore the city when you go into the centre. There is information on our <a href="http://windmillwindup.com/2008/Amsterdam.htm#bikes">Amsterdam page</a> about how/where to hire bicycles.<br /><br />All women&#39;s division games will be held at the main fields.</p>
			<h4>Synthetic Fields</h4>
			<p class="p1">With synthetic grass technology improvements in recent years, many of amsterdam&#39;s fields are being converted. Roughly 40% of the windmill windup fields will be synthetic this year. All these fields are the latest technology. In my opinion, players will not need a different pair of cleats. My team has been training on similar synthetic fields all winter and our experience has been very positive. The fields are rubber based, not sand, so friction burns don&#39;t happen like they did with the old technology. Some people prefer to play in long sleeves or with something covering their legs, but it is not necessary.</p>
			<h4>Euro Football Matches</h4>
			<p class="p1">Are you a football nutter afraid of missing a game?  Do not panic, we have organised for you to see the football games at the fields on big screen, with beverages available.</p>
			
			<h3><a name="format"></a>FORMAT</h3>
			<h4>Women's Division</h4>
			<p class="p1"><!-- The format is fully detailed in <a href="files/Ladies seeding and Schedule.xls" target="_new">this spreadsheet</a>. -->There is not a minimum of 18 women's teams, so we will not use the Swiss Draw format in this division.</p>
			<p class="p1">The Women&rsquo;s Division will be two initial pools of seven teams. The top four teams from each pool will be promoted to play quarter finals, semi final and final games. The lower three teams from each pool will play the three teams they have not played yet, in a new pool to determine final standings. They will carry through their results from the first pool.</p>
			<h4>Open Division</h4>
			<p class="p2">The Open Division will once again feature a draw innovation which made its debut at previous windups. You'll taste the delights of the Swiss Draw format which was first devised and used for chess competitions in Switzerland.</p>
			<p class="p3">In the Open Division, all games will be played out to 15 points, no time restriction, this is traditional from previous windups. NOTE: The organisors reserve the right to impose time cap on games if weather or conditions or other factors play a role resulting in schedule delays.</p>
			<p class="p3">We are lucky enough to have a sufficient number of fields so that all the teams in the Open division are playing matches simultaneously. The first round match-ups are virtually random. Then&hellip;</p>
			<p class="p3">Please report your scores to Frisbee Central (TD) or any staff member (blue shirts). Each game has its win-loss converted to Victory Points. That is, the difference between scores is converted to Victory Points using the following scale.</p>
			
			<TABLE ID="tableVP">
				<CAPTION>Victory Point (VP) Scale<br><br></CAPTION>
				<TR class="row0">
					<TD>Margin of Victory</TD>
					<TD>VPs for Winner</TD>
					<TD>VPs for Loser</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>1</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>14</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>2</TD><TD>17</TD><TD>13</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>3</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>12</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>4</TD><TD>19</TD><TD>11</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>5</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>10</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>6</TD><TD>21</TD><TD>9</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>7</TD><TD>22</TD><TD>8</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>8</TD><TD>23</TD><TD>7</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>9</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>6</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>10</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>5</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>11</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>12</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>3</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>13</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>2</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row2"><TD>14</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>1</TD></TR>
				<TR class="row1"><TD>15</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>0</TD></TR>
			</TABLE>

			<p class="p3">So the maximum you can get is 25 VPs and the minimum 0.</p>
			<p class="p3">This is popular because teams nearly always score something and the whole point of the style is that a team, clearly beaten, needs to battle to the finish as it is the margin which matters. Likewise, just winning is not winning much.</p>
			<p class="p3">The draw for the next round simply consists of ranking the teams by VPs. and resorting to allow that no team plays the same team twice. 1st plays 2nd, 3rd plays 4th etc. etc. A team&rsquo;s VPs are carried forward throughout the tournament.</p>
			<p class="p3">Tie-break method for teams that have an equal amount of VPs at the end of any given Round of the Swiss Draw: For &ndash; Against (goal difference) for the whole tournament thus far. If teams are still tied, it will go to Spirit scores, and then a random method will be used at the TDs discretion (probably a coin toss or random number or paper-scissors-rock).</p>
			<p class="p3">This Division will play 6 rounds of this format to rank the teams. At the end of 6 rounds, the division splits into 1-8, 9-16, 17-24, 25-32 &amp; 33-36. These groups will play quarter finals, semi finals and finals to get your final finishing position (33-36 will likely play round robin).</p>
			<p class="p3">If this explanation is as clear as mud to you, then feel free to email us with questions, or ask us at the tournament. Yeah! Remember, this Swiss Draw is tried and true in many competitive arenas. I have personally seen it work well at Bridge and Touch Football tournaments back home in Australia, as well as last year's Windup.</p>
			<p class="p3">It is very important that team captains ensure that the TD has their match scores <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> when each game finishes. Otherwise calculating the following round games will be impossible. Please give us all your help with this. If you do not have a scorekeeper at your field, please do it yourself and report your scores to the organisor&rsquo;s tent.</p>
			<p class="p3">Thank you!</p>

			<h3><a name="winddown"></a>PARTIES</h3>
			<p class="p1">All Abroad the Partytrain! How can you possibly come to Amsterdam and not party? Exaclty, two nites of dutchy vibes mixed with local and international tunes.</p>
			<h4>Friday Night</h4>
			<p class="p2">Friday night will be kicked off with our latest tradition of a charity fundraiser.  Last year we had a very successful speed dating for our ultimate singles, this year we are offering the world's first <strong>Charity Chicken Fight</strong>.</p>
			<p class="p2">Handmade pizza will be for sale for dinner.  Preorder in the registration tent.  Teams can also make their way <a href="files/metro.pdf" target="_new">by Metro</a> to the <strong>Nieuwmarkt Area</strong> (close to the Red Light District) to taste some eclectic international cuisines.  Restaurants in the area are listed on the <a href="amsterdam.htm#restaurants">Amsterdam page</a>.</p>

			<p class="p2">Afraid of where you are going to watch the Netherlands vs. France Football match? Fear no more.  We will be broadcasting the game big screen at one of the canteens on the fields.  Wear your supporting colours and cheer on your favorite teams.</p>
			<p class="p2">Friday night, feel free to kick back and relax at the fields. Share a few beers with your team and fellow ultimate players and unwind after the games.  You can also make your way up into the city to enjoy Amsterdam’s many nightlife options, the last metro is at midnight and then there are night buses that can bring you back.</p>
			<p class="p2"><strong>Charity Chicken Fight Details:</strong>  Donate 2 Euros and join the fun. Windmill Windup will match your donations euro-for-euro - proceeds to <a href="http://www.openarmsmalawi.org/" target="_new">Open Arms Malawi</a>. Fun begins at 8pm and should only take about 15 minutes.</p>
			<p class="p2">The game is simple, all participants will cross one leg over the other and always keep at least one hand on their lower leg.  Participants will attempt to bump over or out-hop their opponents. You are OUT if you have 2 feet on the ground OR let go of your lower leg. You may not use your free hand to pull/push opponents.  The last participant left standing will be crowned the <strong>Ultimate Cock</strong> and receive their due prize.</p>

			<h4>Saturday Night</h4>
			<p class="p3">On Saturday, Party at the fields! We start off with the now famous <strong>Dutchy Delight Beer Race</strong>: Come test your eating, drinking and random trick abilities in our beer race designed to introduce both the participants and the spectators to some of the famous Amsterdam specialties in under 10 minutes.  Every participant is a winner - they get free beer. <strong>Bubbly Prizes</strong> for the team that finishes first. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP0WPVaK2VI" target="_new">Video from last year</a></p>
			<p class="p3">The race is followed by the <strong>third edition</strong> remodeled Massively Intense <strong>Mingle Mingle</strong>, a huge gathering of people dancing and mingling with other teams to only be stopped by the call of positions by the loud mouth announcer. The game is simple, grab yourself a random partner, arrange yourselves into the called out positions. Prizes for the winning couple. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9nWSAamkwQ" target="_new">Video from last year</a></p>
			<p class="p3">Then, the Party! To bump the party into motion we’ve got a local SKA Band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rolfdeband" target="_new">"ROLF"</a> to get you boppin&rsquo; and boucin&rsquo;.  Once you're in full swing Windmill’s own DJ Didier Drogba and DJ Snowy will rip up the dance floor with rockin&rsquo; tunes that will keep your hips swinging till the early morning.  Keep your ears open for the classic Chocomel Chug and Musical Chairs with a twist, which will offer more prizes and hilarity.</p>


			<h3><a name="food"></a>FOOD </h3>

			<h3><a name="massage"></a>FREE MASSAGE &amp; PHYSIOTHERAPISTS </h3>
			<p class="p1">The Windup will once again offer free massages to players on Saturday and Sunday. Shameless, I know, but we are advertising it. </p>
			<p class="p1">On all three days there will be a physio to help and advise you with your aches, pains and injuries. </p>
			

			<h3><a name="womens"></a>WOMEN'S PICKUP TEAM</h3>
			<p class="p1">There will be a women's pick-up team, so  <a href="mailto:windmillwindup@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you want to join. All welcome!</p>
			
			<h3><a name="Accommodation"></a>ACCOMMODATION</h3>
			<p class="p2">Accommodation is camping. We will be setting up camp in our on-site tent city, we will have camping marshals to show you when you get there. If you want to stay in a hostel or hotel, we provide information below. If you need any assistance on booking we will try to help out, but booking is primarily your responsibility. It is advised to book well in advance since the tourist season starts at that time.</p>
			<h4>Camping</h4>
			<p class="p3">The camping area will be open as of 17:00 on Thursday the 28th of June, but if you would like to arrive earlier on Thursday, you are welcome to, though it will be at your own risk -- there will not be anyone supervising the camping area before Thursday evening. </p>
			<p class="p3">Camping at the fields will be on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights of the tournament. If you want pre or post tournament camping <a href="http://www.amsterdam.info/camping/" target="_new">this link</a> has information all about camping in / around amsterdam.</p>
			<h4>Hotels and Hostels</h4>
			<p class="p2">We gathered some information about hotels and hostels. There are not many options within walking distance of the fields. But these 3 Hotels are relatively close by the fields:</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.hotels.nl/amsterdam/casa/" target="_new">Hotel Casa 400</a> (***)<br />
	James Wattstraat 75<br />
	1097 DL Amsterdam<br />
	tel: 	+31-(0)20-6651171<br />
	fax: 	+31-(0)20-6630379</p>

<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.bastionhotels.nl/en/ourhotels/amsterdam" target="_new">Bastion Hotel Amsterdam/Amstel</a><br />
	Verl. Van Marwijk Kooystraat 30<br />
	1096 BX  Amsterdam<br />
	Tel: 	+31-(0)20-6634567<br />
	Fax: 	+31-(0)20-6633116</p>

<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.accorhotels.com/accorhotels/fichehotel/gb/mer/1244/fiche_hotel.shtml" target="_new">Mercure Hotel Amsterdam Aan de Amstel</a> (****)<br />
	Joan Muyskenweg 10 <br />
	1096 CJ AMSTERDAM<br />
	tel:	+31-(0)20-6658181<br />
	fax:	+31-(0)20-6948735</p>

<p class="p2">The hotels above are ordered from closest to the fields to further away. Hotel Casa is the best deal (and big), however it fills up quite fast usually. Hotel Bastion looks on a map very close to the fields but there is a canal in between the fields and the hotel, which you must walk/drive around, however it is still a doable distance.  The Mercure Hotel is not for those who want to walk to the fields. You will need a car or bikes.</p>
<p class="p2">Another good possibility is to sleep in a hostel in the centre of Amsterdam and take the metro/bus/tram to Amstel-station. From there it's a 10 minute walk to the fields. Try to book a hostel or hotel next to a metro stop, because it can bring you to railway station Amsterdam Amstel the fastest. Below we have noted some information on hostels.</p>
