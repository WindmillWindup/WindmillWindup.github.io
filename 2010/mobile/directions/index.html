        <h4>Some tips for taking buses in the Netherlands:</h4>
    <ul>
            <li>generally the bus driver will be able to speak some English</li>
            <li>tell the driver you are going to Sportpark De Eendracht and that you need to get off at Wittewaalpad: 
            'with the waal path'. Or bring a note with you ;-). 
            Most drivers will be so kind as to tell you where to get off.</li>
            <li>Cheapest way to travel with a bus or tram is with an <a href="http://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/allesoverdeov-chipkaart/watisdeovchipkaart/">'OV chipcard'</a>. 
            OV chipcards are sold at all rail stations. 
            Only one person can travel with a card.
            Check in when entering a bus or tram and don't forget to check out. 
            <br />The easiest way to travel is to buy a single travel card in a bus or tram, this is a bit more expensive. 
            Around 3 euro from Central Station to the fields.</li>        
        </ul>
