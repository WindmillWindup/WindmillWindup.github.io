Note that not all content is actually present in this archive. Pictures (from Flickr, Google etc.) and Amazon content 
might stop working all of a sudden, when those hosting services are turned off.

In order to create a static copy, scrape the current site using
```
> wget -P . -mpck --user-agent="" -e robots=off --wait 1 -E http://windmilltournament.com
```
was used, which is <a href="http://www.explainshell.com/explain?cmd=wget+-P+.+-mpck+--user-agent%3D%22%22+-e+robots%3Doff+--wait+1+-E+http%3A%2F%2Fwindmilltournament.com">explained here</a>.

After that, move the appropriate directory called year (e.g. 2017) and adjust index.html accordingly.
