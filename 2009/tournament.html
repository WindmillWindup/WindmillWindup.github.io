            	<h3>Friday</h3>
                <p>Friday night will be kicked off with our latest tradition of a charity fundraiser. 
                	Last year we had a very successful match of hopping chickens, this year we are presenting the <strong>Windmill Windup Charity Pub Quiz</strong>.
                 </p>
                <p>
                	After the games, feel free to kick back and relax at the fields. Share a few beers with your team and fellow ultimate players.
                    <br />Limited amounts of handmade pizza will be for sale for dinner, and we will fire up the BBQ as well. 
                    Preorder pizzas in the registration tent. 
                    <br />Teams can also make their way by Bus (see directions section of the site) to the city center to taste some eclectic international cuisines. 
                    Restaurants in the center (specifically the Nieuwmarkt area) are listed on the <a href="amsterdam.html#restaurants">Amsterdam page</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
    				<strong>Windmill Windup Charity Pubquiz!</strong>
                    <br />What is the longest river in Africa? What is the second highest peak in the Himalayas? And who invented vulcanized rubber?
            		<br />If you think you know the answers to questions like these, you should sign up for the first <strong>Windmill Windup Charity Pubquiz!</strong> 
            				This year we have expanded our entertainment program with an awesome pubquiz, hosted by our most erudite volunteers Hilco and Tim!            
                	<br />
                    <br />After the <strong>Windmill Windup Charity PubQuiz</strong>, our djs will provide some chill tunes to lounge out the rest of the night with.

            	<h3>Saturday</h3>
                <p>On Saturday, Party at the fields! We start off with the now famous <strong>Dutchy Delight Beer Race</strong>: Come test your eating, drinking and random trick abilities in our beer race designed to introduce both the participants and the spectators to some of the famous Amsterdam specialties in under 10 minutes. Every participant is a winner - they get free beer. <strong>Bubbly Prizes</strong> for the team that finishes first. <a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE_2UZcNCJk">Watch a video from last year</a>.</p>
                <p>The race is followed by the <strong>4th edition</strong> remodeled Massively Intense <strong>Mingle Mingle</strong>, a huge gathering of people dancing and mingling with other teams to only be stopped by the call of positions by the loud mouth announcer. The game is simple, grab yourself a random partner, arrange yourselves into the called out positions. Prizes for the winning duo. <a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9nWSAamkwQ">Watch the video from last year</a></p>
                <p>Then, the <strong>PARTY!</strong> To beat the party into motion we’ve got a wicked Funk band, <a rel="external" href="http://www.bomblb.nl">BombBL</a>  to get you bumppin’ and boucin’. Once you're in full swing, Windmill’s own DJ Drogba will rip up the dance floor with some choice tunes that will keep your feet bouncing till the early morning. Keep your ears open for the classic Chocomel Chug and Musical Chairs with a twist, which will offer more prizes and hilarity.</p>

            The 2009 windup will be at a new location this year, because the new sports complex is ideal for our tournament – lots of lush grass fields at one location, fantastic facilities and party venue, great show pitch, excellent access to public transport etc etc.

                <br />Go straight and pass by two traffic lights till you hit a roundabout (following direction Geuzenveld/Slotermeer). 
                <br />Take at the roundabout the first turn-off to your right (Antony Modderstraat, direction Geuzenveld).

            <h3>By public transport</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>From Central Station </strong>
                <br />Take Citybus 21 (GVB) with destination Geuzenveld. 
                <br />You will find this city bus on your right hand across the water when you exit Central Station on the side of the city center. 
                <br />The bus leaves about every 10 minutes and the trip takes about 25 minutes. 
                <br />The last bus leaves at 0.22 h. Get off at busstop 'Freule Wittewaalpad'. 
                <br />That’s it, all you have to do after that is follow the arrows to the front entrance of the sportspark! 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>From Station Sloterdijk </strong>
                <br />Take Bus 192 (GVB) with destination Schiphol Zuid P30. 
                <br />You can find the buses in front of the station. 
                <br />Buses leave every half hour. The trip takes only 10 minutes. 
                <br />Get off at busstop 'Freule Wittewaalpad'. 
                <br />That’s it, all you have to do after that is follow the arrows to the front entrance of the sportspark! 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <strong>From Schiphol Airport </strong>
                <br />The easiest is to take Bus 192 with direction ‘Amsterdam Sloterdijk’. 
                <br />Follow the bus station sign to find the buses. 
                <br />The bus leaves every 15 minutes during daytime, after 18.00 h it leaves every 30 minutes (at .25 and at .55). 
                <br />The last bus leaves at 0.25 h. The trip takes about 35 minutes. Get off at busstop 'Freule Wittewaalpad'. 
                <br />That’s it, all you have to do after that is follow the arrows to the front entrance of the sportspark! 
            </p>
            <p>
            	<strong>Some tips for taking buses in the Netherlands:</strong>
                <ul>
                	<li>generally the bus driver will be able to speak some English</li>
                	<li>tell the driver you are going to Sportpark De Eendracht and that you need to get off at Wittewaalpad: ‘with the waal path’. Or bring a note with you ;-). Most drivers will be so kind as to tell you where to get off.</li>
                    <li>the cheapest way to pay for your bus ticket is with a ‘strippenkaart’. Strippenkaarts are sold at all rail stations, newspaper shops, post offices and all Albert Hein grocery stores. Several people can travel on one strippenkaart. Just tell the driver where you are going and he will stamp your strippenkaart (from Station Sloterdijk: 2 strippen, from Central Station: 3 strippen, from Schiphol: 4 strippen). A regular strippenkaart has 15 strippen and costs 7.30 euros. A large one has 45 strippen (for the whole team) and costs 21.60. There are cheaper ones for students but you have to be able to show a Dutch OV Studentenkaart if you want to use that. You can pay with cash (preferably coins) in the bus, but this will cost you more and is a bit annoying if you travel with a large group.</li>
           		</ul>
            </p>

            <h3>By bike</h3>
            <p>
                From Central Station it is about 8.3 kilometers.
