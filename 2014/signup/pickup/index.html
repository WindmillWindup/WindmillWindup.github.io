I hope someone is open to have a young player like me in the team. I have played for 7 years now and want to keep it up!

          My specialty is cutting. I make good decisions and never turn the disc over. I dont have a monster huck and I rarely sky people taller than me, but I&#39;m always open. I played for 5 yrs in college (San Diego State) and was the captain my last year. Also, I love to drink

My biggest assets are my size (6&#39;6&#39;&#39;), my agility and my willpower on D. Put me on your D-line to lock down that deep cutter or place me on O to chase down that huck you just send my way. You can also put me on both lines but you&#39;d have to feed me bigtime after the game.

          I am a cutter and a destroyer of hopes &amp; dreams on defense. I&#39;ve played for  6 yrs (3 at club level). I have good hands, quick transitions from O to D, and beat my girl both under &amp; deep. I have been known to watch an entire season on Netflix in one sitting.  Why pick me? I might bring cookies.

          Hey,
I was fortunate enough to visit Herbie last year &amp; as I kinda like him would love to be part of his 10th b-day.
On O I like to cut as I&#39;m fast and agile. But my real love is D! I like pursuing &amp; denying others to run to where they wanna run to. Great fun! 
Open would be fine too.
Cheers.

          Hello
I&#39;ve been playing Ultimate for about 2 years now. I consider myself an advanced rookie, my knowledge is on a basic level. I know how to play the game, but I still learn how to PLAY THE GAME. 
As such I always preferred to play Mixed (what can I say, I like girls :D ).

          Oh hi there!
My biggest assets are my size (6&#39;6&#39;&#39;), my agility and my willpower on D. Put me on your D-line to lock down that deep cutter or place me on O to chase down that huck you just send my way. You can also put me on both lines but you&#39;d have to feed me bigtime after the game.

          I started playing nearly 2 years ago with my college team and absolutely fell in love with Ultimate. I&#39;m a cutter and I particularly enjoy playing zone defense or offense against a zone. I&#39;d describe myself as a solid, dependable player and I&#39;d love to help out any team that wants me! :)

          Hey there. I&#39;m Jessi and I&#39;ve been playing for about 2 years in Germany, mostly as a cutter but sometimes as handler as well.
I love running in the endzone and catching the D. 
My Masterplan is to have a great time on the field and afterwards as well ;)
Looking forward to playing with your team;)

I&#39;d like to participate as pickup, knowing high level of WW and the fact that it is too expensive for my home team to go there

          Hi!Our team was rejected, so I&#39;m looking for a more lucky team to play with :)) I am a good defense player with more than 4 years experience. Can both play as a handler and cutter. Don&#39;t mind playing in mixed. Looking forward to be a part of your team at this perfect tournament!
